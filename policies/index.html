      <div class="prose text-lg col-span-12 italic font-serif text-semiblack" x-data="{show:false}">
        <p>In the run-up to the European elections in the summer of 2024, we offer seven proposals for policy
          interventions in support of the Digital Commons. Building on the foundations laid by the regulation of
          commercial platforms over the past five years, the policies presented below aim to strengthen different forms
          of Digital Commons as building blocks of the European Digital Public Space.</p>


        <div x-show="show" x-collapse>
          <p>The development of Digital Commons is one of the greatest achievements of the digital transformation of the
            last 25 years. New forms of collaboration and sharing enabled by the internet have given rise to digital
            resources that are created and managed by communities that share them openly according to established rules,
            the open source software industry, open-access research in the European Research Area, Wikipedia, and open
            government data being prime examples.</p>
          <p>Over the same period of time, Europe faced the challenge of the growing power of commercial platforms that
            dominate the internet today.</p>
          <p>The initial vision of an open, non-commercial internet has been replaced by a digital domain divided into
            closed communication networks controlled by commercial actors. The original, interoperable internet still
            functions as a basic communication layer. Yet commercial networks built on top of it made users dependent on
            their proprietary systems and solutions. The story of their growth is also a story of extracting value from
            publicly available information and data produced by users.</p>

          <div class="text-base not-italic text-black font-sans">
            <p>Large AI models developed by commercial entities that are trained by scraping the publicly available
              internet and benefit from resources such as Wikipedia are the latest iteration of the enclosure of the
              Digital Commons. This is <a href="#">the Paradox of Open</a>: while openness offers the strongest
              counterbalance to the corporate enclosure of information and culture, it is also vulnerable to
              exploitation and can even serve as an enabler of the concentration of power.</p>
            <p>Over the last five years, the European Commission has redefined its approach to the Digital Single Market
              by introducing policies that focus on safeguarding fundamental rights and European values.
              Symptomatically, the flagship initiatives of the Commission&rsquo;s current digital policy package — the
              Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act — regulate dominant platforms to protect fundamental
              rights, create a safer digital space, and increase competition in digital markets. These regulations
              address the above paradox by reducing forms of exploitation, making commercial platforms more accountable
              for the systemic risks they create, and forcing at least a limited opening up of their services and
              resources.</p>
            <p>In parallel, the policies and regulations that give life to Europe&rsquo;s new data strategy are based on
              a vision of data governance that balances the protection of rights with the flow and reuse of data. New
              regulatory mechanisms create new opportunities for data sharing, and Europe hopes to create open and
              interoperable data spaces.</p>
            <p>In other words, these policies create an opportunity to build an internet that is not only a commercial
              marketplace but also <a href="#">a Digital Public Space</a>. This ambition has been recognized in the
              European Union&rsquo;s Declaration on Digital Rights and Principles for the Digital Decade, which includes
              participation in the digital public sphere as one of its key principles. This is an important declaration
              that paves the way for new policies to ensure that digital technologies enable a just and democratic
              society. Where fundamental freedoms and rights are protected, strong public institutions work in the
              public interest, and where people have a say in how services they depend on work.</p>
            <p>We believe that in the coming years, Europe will have the opportunity to shape such a digital society.
              Building on the foundations set by this Commission&rsquo;s regulation of commercial platforms, the next
              digital policy package needs to focus on strengthening different forms of Digital Commons and protecting
              them from exploitation.</p>
