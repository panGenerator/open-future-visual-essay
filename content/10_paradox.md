title: "The Paradox of Open"
---
Today, Open is both a challenge to and an enabler of concentrations of power.
The ideas of open access and free reuse of information goods continue to be some of the most powerful challenges to the exclusive control by corporations and states over information goods.
Yet at the same time making such resources open also exposes them to the imbalances of power that shape these societies - and in worst cases serves to strengthen these imbalances.
Open on its own provides little in terms of protection from potential abuses of such power. These models and tools, focused on generating added value, fail to address any potential losses and harms that derive from such use.
