The deeply ingrained focus on combating existing practices of exclusive control of  information resources has made us blind to the emergence of platform intermediaries, and to the risks that they pose for the networked information ecosystem..  

These new platform intermediaries have mainly been seen as allies in the fight against existing, closed information intermediaries. We need to acknowledge that the landscape is a lot more complicated today.

The fact that these allies build their platforms without embracing the open movement’s rules and principles (while skillfully adopting the its language of sharing), has never created enough friction to make the open movement reconsider its theory of action. As a result the “the enemy of my enemy is my friend” logic has largely prevailed.  

A generation of activists for whom the defining moments of their careers has been the opposition of traditional information intermediaries to the emergent reality of the networked information economy of the early 2000s has not managed to break with this increasingly outdated antagonistic view and embrace a more systemic perspective instead.
