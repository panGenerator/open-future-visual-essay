The deeply ingrained focus on combating existing practices of exclusive control of information resources has made us blind to the emergence of platform intermediaries and to the risks that they pose for the networked information ecosystem.

These new platform intermediaries have mainly been seen as allies in the fight against the earlier, closed information intermediaries. We need to acknowledge that the landscape is far more complicated today.

The fact that perceived allies build their platforms without embracing the Open movement’s rules and principles (while skilfully adopting the movement’s language of sharing) has never created enough friction to make the Open movement reconsider its theory of action. As a result, the logic “the enemy of my enemy is my friend” has largely prevailed.

A generation of activists for whom the defining moment of their careers was the opposition of traditional information intermediaries to the emergent reality of the networked information economy of the early 2000s has not managed to break with this increasingly outdated, antagonistic view and instead embraces a more systemic perspective.
