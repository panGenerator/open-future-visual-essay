title: "Sharing platforms  \nconquer  \nthe open  \n_web"

Over the last decade, we have witnessed a wholesale transformation of the networked information ecosystem. The web moved away from the ideals and the open design of the early internet and turned into an environment that is dominated by a small number of platforms.  

This concentration of digital power in the hands of a small number of platform intermediaries has fundamentally altered the way in which this ecosystem operates. With it, the context for open production and sharing has changed as well.  

In parallel, we have seen the emergence of a robust networked information economy that has resulted in ever more information resources becoming available online. While the open movement had initially constituted itself in response to a perceived lack of availability of information and content, it is now operating within a context of abundance of the same resources.
