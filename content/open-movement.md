At Open Future, we explore challenges that the digital world faces not just right now, but also in the future. We do this in order to design policies that address these challenges today. We put our knowledge, experience and focus to work along EU institutions, decision makers and civic society on understanding the challenges from all the necessary perspectives.

We believe that here in Europe we can launch a mission to keep the internet open and make it better. To rebuild it, so that it is a place governed by equal opportunities, democratic access to information and respect for **fundamental rights.** A public space built on the idea of the commons.

We think that the current European policy environment provides a real opportunity to realise these objectives by enacting meaningful legislative change. At the same time we are also setting our sights on developing initiatives for the next European Commission to take up.
