There is still significant value in open, but only in those content ecosystems that have not yet been dominated by online platforms — the way the mainstream cultural and information landscape has been. These are largely professional and institutional environments.  

In these ‘traditional’ ecosystems, copying content is still a viable option: educational publishers copy content from OER repositories, Open Access models enable flow of content between different academic publishing and library systems, and text and data mining practices treat copying of data as a crucial functionality. In these contexts, legal solutions are needed to mediate content usage rules between different proprietary platforms and environments.  

We should expect these ecosystems to soon fall under platform logic. It is slowly time to admit that a multitude of small victories is not enough in face of the monopolistic power wielded by today's platforms. The only sensible action is to invest in alternatives to these platforms, ones that respect openness and other democratic values.
