We are just one among many organisations that identify with the vision of digital commons, openness and access to knowledge. We also feel part of a new cohort of digital organisations that have launched in recent years, and in a very different zeitgeist than that of twenty years ago. We launched at a time when resilience and sustainability are crucial, and there’s a sense that the broad digital movement needs to work together. We are looking for partners, who want to think together in terms of collective impact and systemic change.
