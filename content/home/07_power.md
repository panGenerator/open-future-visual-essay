Put differently, under the conditions created by an information ecosystem dominated by a small number of platforms, open resources are most likely to contribute to the power of those with the best means to make use of them.  

In almost all fields of application, Open has been used to challenge the power of publishers and entertainment industry gatekeepers. At the point where the power of these old information intermediaries is supplanted by a new generation of platform-based information intermediaries, the value of the Open approach reaches its limits. 

As long as Open is being defined mainly as a response to the former, exclusivity-based strategies for managing access to information, Open does not account for the power structures that have emerged in the massively intermediated information economy.<!--more-->In practical terms opening up information through the instruments developed and refined by Open movement organisations (such as open licenses and open standards) removes friction from the networked information ecosystem, making information resources easier to exploit by anyone for any purpose.  

As advocates of openness, we have largely failed to take into account the negative externalities related to the permissive sharing of all kinds of information. Today, this situation contributes to the power imbalances that we observe.  

While the Open movement pioneered the use of the networked information environment for the sharing of informational resources, it has not (yet) managed to impress its normative ideals about sharing on the sharing platforms that currently dominate the networked information economy.
