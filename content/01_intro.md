Numerous organisations and initiatives have been launched with a belief in openness and free knowledge. Their proponents placed their bets on the combined power of networked information services and new governance models for the production and sharing of content and data.
We – as members of this broad movement – were among those who believed it possible to leverage this combination of power and opportunity to build a more democratic society, unleashing the power of the internet to create universal access to knowledge and culture. For us, such openness meant not only freedom, but also presented a path to justice and equality.

This opportunity was aptly theorised in 2006 by Yochai Benkler whose work “The wealth of networks” explained the value of commons-based peer production. It was a clear model for collective action to create digital commons.
