title: "Open does not account for structures of  \n_power"

Put differently, under the conditions created by an information ecosystem dominated by a small number of platforms, open resources are most likely to contribute to the power of those with the best means to make use of them.  

In almost all fields of application open has been used to challenge the power of publishers and entertainment industry gatekeepers. Once the power of these old information intermediaries has been supplanted by a new generation of platform based information intermediaries, the value of the open approach reaches its limits.  

Open does not take into account the power structures that have emerged in the massively intermediated information economy as long as it is being defined mainly in relation to former, exclusivity-based strategies for managing access to information, In practical terms opening up information, through the instruments developed and refined by open movement organisations (such as open licenses and open standards) removes friction from the networked information ecosystem. It makes information resources easier to exploit by anyone for any purpose.  

As advocates of openness we have largely failed to take into account the negative externalities related to permissive sharing of all kinds of information. Today they contribute to the power imbalances that we observe.  

While the open movement has pioneered the use of the networked information environment for sharing of informational resources, it has not (yet) managed to impress its normative ideas about sharing on the sharing platforms that dominate today the networked information economy.
