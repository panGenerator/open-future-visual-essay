We are a new organisation, yet founded by people active in the open movement for the last two decades. We believe in openness, but also believe that it needs to be imagined anew. Today, openness increasingly functions as not just a challenge to concentrations of power, but also their enabler. Openness, once a rebel vision, is now part of the status quo - one that needs to be questioned.

We believe that open sharing and the commons still hold great promise. Yet we need to evolve the mode of operation and adapt to  a changing environment that has become increasingly centralised. We need a new vision of open, resilient against abuse and unintended externalities. This will require finding shared perspectives between advocates of openness and defenders of privacy and other fundamental rights.
