title: "An Open Future"
subtitle: "The paradox of open can be solved here, in Europe"

That is our core belief at Open Future: that Europe has a unique opportunity to restore some of the original promise of the internet. It is here that policymakers and key stakeholders have the ambition to build an internet for the people. One that can provide the basis for a more just and democratic society.
There is much debate today - in Europe and beyond - about building shared digital public spaces that can compete with the dominant, corporate walled gardens that harm the internet and its users.
A European, values-based vision of technological development, commitment to supporting public institutions and the public sphere, and novel ideas about data and content governance will help to solve the paradox of open.
