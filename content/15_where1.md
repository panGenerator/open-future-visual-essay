title: "Where we will go from here:"
subtitle: "1. Understanding the New Open"
---
It is time to define once again what open means. What is the normative vision behind sharing and its value promise. Open should not just mean releasing resources into a digital void - the term should stand for managing use of resources in a way that maximizes public benefit, while avoiding harms. a balance between openness of resources and preservation of privacy (and other fundamental rights).
We will contribute to this new vision of open through sensemaking work and creating new narratives.
